        <h1>School district going into spring break!</h1> 
		<h2>Students looking forward to brief vacation as end of school year comes into view</h2>

    		The date is 3/23/2024 and local area school district KUSD is preparing for finals week and releasing 			 their students into spring break. Students across the area are excitedly awaiting their vacation. 				Many having plants for travel, meeting with family, and attending various events.
    	</p>
        <p>
        	The break serves as a well deserved, and much needed, break for students and teachers as the final 				quarter of the school year comes into focus. Serving as the midway point for many classes. Allowing 			students and staff to recharge for this final stretch is a much appreciated tradition.
    	</p>
        <p>
        	We wish the students and staff at Kenosha Unified School District a happy, relaxing, and enjoyable 				spring break. As we can clearly tell the locals look forward to it.
